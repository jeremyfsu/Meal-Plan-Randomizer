== Meal Plan Randomizer
The hardest part (for me) of meal planning is trying to think of what meals I want.  I'm too
lazy or don't have the patience for flipping through our recipe book.

This app strives to remedy this by randomly picking out a week's worth of meals with a single
click. It chooses from a list of your favorite meals to cook. For those (like me) who enjoy
leftovers, it will account for eating leftovers for lunch or dinner the next night.
